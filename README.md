# Generative-Adversarial-Networks-for-financial-time-series-generation

This is the code I used for my master thesis at the University of Cambridge. It generates artificial financial time series using Recurrent Generative Adversarial Networks. 
Both the theoretical approach and the implementation are based on the method of Hyland et al. for generative modelling of time series.
